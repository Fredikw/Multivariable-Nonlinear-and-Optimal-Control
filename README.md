## Lab project - Linear State Feedback Control

Objective 1: Simulate controller at home

- Try different weights	OK
- Compare the results
	- Visually, plot the response in alpha and delta
	- Different figure-of-merit, RMSE/SSE, L1-norm

Objective 2: Do the same for the physical system

- Compare the physical system with the simulation

Objective 3:

- Try to obtain the best design (how do you
define it?). Compare the different options you have considered using an objective
figure of merit, such as the tracking error mean square value or other. How can
you to improve the results by changing the controller in order to make the angle ùõº
stand still?
